## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis of the `insurance.csv` dataset aims to identify the key factors influencing medical insurance charges. Our findings reveal that **smoking status** is by far the most dominant predictor of higher charges, followed significantly by **age** and **BMI category (obesity)**. Other factors like sex, number of children, and geographic region show less pronounced impacts, though regional nuances exist. These insights are crucial for insurance providers to refine risk assessment, optimize premium structures, and develop targeted wellness programs.

The project delivers a complete data analytics solution featuring an advanced ETL pipeline, rigorous statistical hypothesis testing, and interactive dashboards (both Streamlit and Power BI) that transform complex healthcare insurance data into actionable business intelligence.

## Dataset Content

The dataset contains **1,338 healthcare insurance records** from a medical cost personal dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes comprehensive policyholder information with the following features:

- **age**: Age of primary beneficiary (18-64 years)
- **sex**: Insurance contractor gender (female/male) 
- **bmi**: Body mass index (15.96-53.13)
- **children**: Number of children covered by health insurance (0-5)
- **smoker**: Smoking status (yes/no)
- **region**: Beneficiary's residential area (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)
- **charges**: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance ($1,122-$63,770)

### Data Completeness
- **Dataset Quality**: 100% complete data with zero missing values across all columns
- **Data Integrity**: 1 duplicate record removed during cleaning process
- **Sample Distribution**: Balanced representation across demographics and regions
- **Dataset Size**: Manageable at approximately 55KB, well within repository limits

### Initial Observations
- **Age**: Ranges from 18 to 64, with relatively even distribution across age groups
- **BMI**: Right-skewed distribution with significant portion in overweight/obese categories (54% of sample)
- **Charges**: Highly right-skewed, indicating most charges are moderate with small percentage of high-cost claims
- **Categorical Balance**:
  - Sex: Fairly balanced (50.5% male, 49.5% female)
  - Smoker: Imbalanced with 20.5% smokers, 79.5% non-smokers
  - Region: Relatively balanced across four geographical regions

## Business Requirements

Develop an automated ETL pipeline to process healthcare insurance data and ensure data quality validation for reliable analysis.

Identify primary cost drivers in healthcare insurance through statistical hypothesis testing to inform pricing strategies and risk assessment.

Create interactive data visualizations that communicate complex insurance cost relationships to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Design a prototype premium calculator based on statistical findings to enable real-time insurance quote estimation and risk scoring.

Provide actionable business intelligence recommendations for insurance pricing optimization, wellness programs, and regional strategy development.

## Hypothesis and How to Validate?

**H1: Smoking significantly increases healthcare insurance costs**
- *Validation Method*: Two-sample t-test comparing smokers vs non-smokers charges
- *Result*: t=57.32, p<0.001 (HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT) 
- *Effect Size*: 3.5x cost multiplier ($32,050 vs $8,434 average)
- *Business Impact*: Smoking status is the strongest predictor of high insurance costs

**H2: Age positively correlates with insurance costs**
- *Validation Method*: Pearson correlation analysis between age and charges
- *Result*: r=0.299, p<0.001 (SIGNIFICANT)
- *Interpretation*: Moderate positive relationship supporting age-based pricing

**H3: BMI impacts healthcare costs, particularly obesity (BMI â‰¥ 30)**
- *Validation Method*: Correlation analysis and BMI category comparison
- *Result*: r=0.198, p<0.001 (SIGNIFICANT)
- *Business Impact*: Obesity threshold adds approximately $4,623 annually

**H4: Regional differences exist in healthcare insurance costs**
- *Validation Method*: One-way ANOVA across four regions
- *Result*: F=2.74, p<0.05 (SIGNIFICANT)
- *Finding*: Southeast region shows highest costs with notable outliers
